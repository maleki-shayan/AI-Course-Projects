## Project Details

### 1. Search Agents in Pacman (CA1)
**Topic:** State Space Search & Heuristics  
This project involves designing intelligent agents for the classic **Pacman** game. The goal was to implement various search algorithms to help Pacman navigate the maze and eat all dots efficiently.

- **Algorithms Implemented:**
  - Breadth-First Search (BFS)
  - Depth-First Search (DFS)
  - Uniform Cost Search (UCS)
  - A* Search (A-Star) with custom heuristics
  - Weighted A* Search
- **Key Concepts:** Graph Traversal, Heuristic Design, Optimality vs. Complexity.

### 2. [Project 2 Title] (CA2)
*(Please update this section. Based on typical AI curriculums, this might be **Genetic Algorithms**, **Game Playing (Minimax)**, or **Constraint Satisfaction Problems**)*.

**Topic:** [e.g., Genetic Algorithms / Game Theory]  
[Brief description of what you solved in this project. Example: "Implemented an evolutionary algorithm to solve the N-Queens problem" or "Designed a Minimax agent with Alpha-Beta pruning for a board game".]

- **Key Concepts:** [e.g., Selection, Crossover, Mutation / Minimax, Alpha-Beta Pruning]

### 3. [Project 3 Title] (CA3)
*(Please update this section. This is likely **Probabilistic Reasoning (Bayesian Networks)**, **HMMs**, or **Logic**)*.

**Topic:** [e.g., Probabilistic Reasoning / NLP]  
[Brief description of the project. Example: "Used Bayesian Networks to predict events based on uncertain data" or "Implemented Hidden Markov Models for speech/text recognition".]

- **Key Concepts:** [e.g., Bayesian Networks, Sampling, Inference, HMM]

### 4. Deep Learning & Neural Networks (CA4)
**Topic:** Neural Networks, CNNs, & Sentiment Analysis  
A comprehensive introduction to Deep Learning using **PyTorch**. This project consists of multiple tasks involving image classification and text analysis.

- **Tasks:**
  - **PyTorch Warmup:** Basic tensor operations and gradient descent.
  - **Computer Vision:** Implementing a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** for image classification.
  - **NLP:** Performing **Sentiment Analysis** on the SnappFood comments dataset.
- **Key Concepts:** Backpropagation, Activation Functions, Convolution, Loss Functions.

### 5. Unsupervised Learning (CA5)
**Topic:** Clustering & Dimensionality Reduction  
This project focuses on finding hidden patterns in unlabeled datasets using unsupervised learning techniques.

- **Tasks:**
  - Data Preprocessing and Visualization.
  - **Clustering:** Implementing algorithms like K-Means or DBSCAN.
  - **Dimensionality Reduction:** Using PCA (Principal Component Analysis) to visualize high-dimensional data.
- **Key Concepts:** Feature Extraction, Elbow Method, Silhouette Score.

### 💡 Tips to make it stand out:
1.  **Fill in CA2 & CA3:** Check your actual code folder for CA2 and CA3. If CA2 involves "Chromosomes" or "Population", it's **Genetic Algorithms**. If it involves "Game", "Player", or "Board", it's **Adversarial Search**.
2.  **Add Images:** In the `Results` section, upload 1-2 images (like a plot from the PyTorch project or a screenshot of the Pacman game) to your repo and link them. This increases engagement significantly.
3.  **Update Links:** Don't forget to replace `[Your Name]`, `[Your LinkedIn]`, and the `git clone` URL with your actual data.
